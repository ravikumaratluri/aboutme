                <h2>Current</h2>
                I am freshman of Spring batch working on my Masters of Applied Computer Science.
                I planned to be graduated by the end of Spring 2020 semester.
                <h2>Back ground</h2>
                I am from Paritala, a small town in India.I had 2 years of experience in software industry.
                I worked as Java developer in Infoview Technologies Pvt Ltd.
                I am familiar with few technologies like RESTful Web Services, JQuery, XML, CSS and also a beginner in
                Angular and node JS.
                <h2>Plans</h2>
                I did my under graduate in Electronics and Communication from the college Amrita Sai Institute of
                Science and technology which is affiliated to Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University.
                Apart from my education and work experience I love playing Badminton when I get a free time.

                    In long run I want to see myself as a Program Analyst.
                    I hope I will achieve this with skills I will gain through my graduation course.
